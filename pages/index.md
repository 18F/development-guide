Welcome to the 18F front end guide! This is where we keep all of our
guidelines for front end design and development.

## What is Front end

The front end guild did a series of exercises to determine the
fundamental differences between the front end design and front end
developer roles at 18F. Using [some of our own research
methods](https://methods.18f.gov), the front end guild came up with
the following recommendations on knowing the difference between the
two disciplines:

**Front end designers** design, write, and implement the
presentational code base for websites and applications. They should
have a clear understanding of design fundamentals and systems, such
as interface style guides, responsive design, grid systems, front end
frameworks, and accessibility best practices. Front end designers
should feel comfortable creating and implementing design systems
using semantic HTML5, CSS/Sass and be able to assist in debugging
this aspect of the code base.

**Front end developers** architect, write, and implement the
functional code base for websites and applications. They should have
a clear understanding of client-side render and response, such as
HTTP methods, API consumption, the browser loading/rendering
pipeline, and accessibility best practices. Front end developers
should feel comfortable developing and implementing client-side
interactions and frameworks using semantic HTML5 and JavaScript, and
should be able to help with debugging, testing, and performance
optimization of the code base.
