## Mixins
- Use mixins for groups of properties that appear together intentionally and
  are used multiple times.

  ```scss
  @mixin clearfix {
    &:after {
      content: '';
      display: table;
      clear: both;
    }
  }
  ```

- Use mixins for components to change size.
- Use mixins when something requires parameters.

  ```scss
  @mixin size($width, $height: $width) {
    width: $width;
    height: $height;
  }
  ```

- Do not use mixins for browser prefixes. Use [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).

  ```scss
  // Bad
  @mixin transform($value) {
    -webkit-transform: $value;
    -moz-transform: $value;
    transform: $value;
  }
  ```


## Extend
Be very careful with using `@extend`. It's a powerful tool that can have
disastrous side-effects. Before using please consider:

- Where is my current selector going to be appended?
- Am I likely to be causing undesired side-effects?
- How large is the CSS generated by this single extend?

If you're unsure of using `@extend`, follow these rules to avoid running into
trouble:

- Use `@extend` from within a module, not across different modules.
- Use `@extend` on [placeholders] exclusively, not on actual selectors.
- Make sure the placeholder you extend is present as little as possible in the
  stylesheet.

You can use [mixins] in place of selectors. While mixins will copy more code,
the difference will often be negligible once the output file has been gzipped.
