title: Project Setup
---

While the specific setup for each TTS project varies widely, there are certain
elements that should be present in all source code repositories. This document
aims to detail those elements and suggest corresponding tools and resources.

## Source code management

TTS projects use GitHub for source code management, with their repositories
under a [government-owned
organization](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/github/#organizations).

- [GitHub](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/github/) {%include components/tag-standard.html %}

## Repository Checklist

Below is an aspirational list of configuration and files for a source
code repository. Not all of these elements will apply to every project (e.g.
visual regression tests don't make sense for an API).

1. [Community profile](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-community-profiles-for-public-repositories)

1. Programming language version specifications (e.g., `.nvmrc`, `runtime.txt`, `Gemfile`)
1. Dependency version descriptions (e.g., `Gemfile`, `Pipfile`, `package.json`) â€” don't forget to
   [pin](https://pages.18f.gov/before-you-ship/infrastructure/pinning-dependencies/)
   them
1. Build scripts
1. Unit test setup for each programming language
1. Linter setup (e.g., [`flake8`](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/),
   [`rubocop`](../ruby/.rubocop.yml),
   [`eslint`](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/blob/master/linters/.eslintrc) {%include components/tag-suggestion.html %})
1. Docker
   - Dockerfiles
   - [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) files
   - [.dockerignore](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file)
1. cloud.gov/Cloud Foundry
   - [Manifests](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html), one per deployment environment (e.g., [18F/fec-cms](https://github.com/18F/fec-cms), [18F/culper](https://github.com/18F/culper/tree/develop/conf/manifests))
   - [`.cfignore`](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/prepare-to-deploy.html#-ignore-unnecessary-files-when-pushing) (can be a symlink to `.gitignore` to get started)
1. Deploy scripts
1. [Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment](#continuous-integrationcontinuous-deployment)
1. [Code coverage metrics](#code-coverage-metrics)
1. [Static analysis for code quality](#static-analysis-for-code-quality)
1. [Static security analysis](https://pages.18f.gov/before-you-ship/security/static-analysis/)
1. [Accessibility scanning](https://engineering.18f.gov/accessibility-scanning/) (e.g., [Pa11y](https://pa11y.org/) {%include components/tag-default.html %})
1. Integration test setup (e.g., [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) {%include components/tag-suggestion.html %})
1. Visual regression setup (e.g., [Backstop](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) {%include components/tag-suggestion.html %})

## Project Management Tool

Every project, no matter the size, should use a project management tool to keep
track of ongoing tasks and to do items. The project management tool should be
linked to somewhere in the project's GitHub repository so that others can find
it easily.

- [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) {%include components/tag-default.html %}
- [Trello](https://trello.com/) {%include components/tag-suggestion.html %}

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment

Developers don't always remember to run the test suite. That's why we have
Continuous Integration services to run the tests automatically after each
commit. CI also helps ensure there's nothing specific to the developer's machine
that makes the tests pass.

A Continuous Deployment service allows a development team to receive rapid
feedback on new features or bug fixes. CD also helps ensure deployment and
infrastructure issues are identified earlier in a release process, and are
scoped to a smaller number of changes.

Pick a CI/CD service with a GitHub integration so that the build status can be seen
for each pull request.

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) {%include components/tag-suggestion.html %}

## Code coverage metrics

Aim for more than 90% of your source code to be covered by tests; worry if
coverage drops below 80%. For repositories with multiple programming
languages/components (e.g., front and back ends), ensure that coverage reports
are aggregated and reported on the entire project, in addition to reports on
individual components.

## Static analysis for code quality

A good [code review process](../code-review/) is essential to writing good code.
But certain code problems are difficult for humans to spot. Duplication, for
example: if new code is an exact duplicate of code from an existing file in a
project, that might not be caught in a code review. Static analysis tools catch
duplication, security concerns, and more. Also see [Static Security
Analysis](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/security/static-analysis/).

## Dependency management

Applications require specific versions of programming languages, libraries,
databases, services, and configuration to execute. A dependency management
solution helps abstract that complexity and makes it easier for cross-functional
teams to create consistent, reproducible, local development environments.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/why-docker) {%include components/tag-suggestion.html %}<br>
  See our [Docker for development](./docker/) recommendations.

## Deployment infrastructure

Developers needing to deploy their code beyond their local environment should
use either:

- a [cloud.gov sandbox](https://cloud.gov/docs/pricing/free-limited-sandbox/) {%include components/tag-standard.html %}
- a TTS-managed [AWS sandbox account](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/infrastructure/sandbox/#aws-sandbox-accounts) {%include components/tag-standard.html %}
- or [Federalist](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/federalist/) (for static web sites) {%include components/tag-standard.html %}

{%include components/tag-caution.html %} The use of tools such as `localtunnel`
and `ngrok`, which make your locally running services visible to the internet,
are not allowed because they present a large security concern. Consult
[`#infrastructure`](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/archives/C039MHHF8) on Slack for any questions.
