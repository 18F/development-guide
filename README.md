# 18F Development Guide

A set of guidelines and best practices for an awesome engineering team.


## How we classify best practices

These documents are structured by topic; under each, we include “Standards”,
“Defaults”, and “Suggestions”.

**Standards** are practices that have a strong consensus across 18F; they
should generally be followed to ease the ATO process and make on-boarding
simpler.

**Defaults** are safe selections that tend to be used by a large number of our
projects; you may find yourself with a better or more tailored solution,
however.

**Suggestions** contain examples that have worked well on a project or two;
they're not widely used enough to be defaults, but are worth considering.

_Note: we've adopted the above classifications but not all the topics have been
updated to use them. Please submit a pull request to recommend particular
classification for discussion._
