## What should I expect on a technical discovery project?

A technical discovery at its core is just a large problem solving activity. You’ll need to dive into many aspects of the project and the people involved in order to understand their current state, then help discover ways to move them forward in a direction that’s helpful for our partners. In the beginning, things will be murky. You may not understand why you’re there, or how an engineer fits into this discovery process. You might know the high-level definition of what the problem is, but may not understand how, technically, you can help. And you may feel like your time is wasted early on. This is okay! As the other parts of your team start digging into their research, your part will become a lot more clear. You may also find that the original problem your team is supposed to solve may evolve a bit, and the technical parts of that will make a lot more sense. 

You might also find it’s very challenging to take all the types of data you’ve collected (like lists of stakeholders, user interviews, background stories on how the tech got where it’s at, etc.) and try to use it to shape it into an easily shareable solution that everyone (including your teammates and the partner agency) can fully understand. This is okay too! You might find that it will come together more towards the end as your team starts gathering to think through the various findings they’ve discovered and you start talking about the final report recommendations.

Though 8 weeks feels like a lot of time at the beginning, that feeling will decrease as you go further in. It won’t feel like you can accomplish all you want to. Because of this, we’d encourage you to get researching as soon as you can after your team has met. We’ll help you understand a good timeline in the sections below.

Finally, there’s no one “right” way to do a technical discovery, and TTS doesn’t have a standard way to do them either. There’s a lot of common steps (like talking to the partner agency stakeholders, learning about the technical systems, and diving deep into some code they already have), but your project will have to take its own path as you move along. This is a good thing! With many research projects, you just have a starting point and a vague direction to go, but by the end, you’ll understand the project very well and can help create a journey that the partner needs to take to solve their problem.
