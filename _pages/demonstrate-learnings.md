## How can I best demonstrate what I learned?

It can be hard to parse all the information as you go, and even harder when you continue to get information thrown at you throughout the 8 weeks. We have a few recommendations on how to take what you’ve learned and present it to the partner agency.

* Make a midpoint presentation with your team to get feedback from the partner
    * Re-explain what you understand their problem to be
    * Show the types of information you’re received already
    * Talk about the direction you see the project going so far and why
    * Bring up what you still need to collect and possible people you need to talk with to get that information.
* Tools and models that could be useful include:
    * Wardley maps
    * Cynefin Framework (pronounced “kuh NEV in”)
    * Conway’s Law
    * Chesterton’s Fence
    * Data Visualization presentation from an Engineering Practices Guild meeting in July 2021
* For technical writing:
    * What to consider? Remember the audience (which may not be the technical people). Consider they may share the report within their organization too.
    * Are there good metaphors you can use to explain things?
    * Restate the initial problems approached to your team
        * This may or may not differ from the problems or solutions you are seeing as a team
* Sample template reports:
    * Path Analysis Report template
    * A second Path Analysis Report template
