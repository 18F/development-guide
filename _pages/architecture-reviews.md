# Architecture Reviews

Though we pride ourselves on our [transparent and remote-friendly
workplace](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/15/best-practices-for-distributed-teams/),
our project focus tends to silo engineers from each other. We can kick-start
knowledge transfer by highlighting some of the more interesting design
decisions from existing projects.
