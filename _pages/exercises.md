## What kind of exercises might be useful?

There are a variety of exercises that might be helpful to run or facilitate as an engineer on a technical discovery project. Here are some that have been used on past projects with a short description of what the exercise can help you achieve.

### Wardley Mapping as a group

Wardley Mapping is an activity that can help teams visualize their technology and process and make decisions about technical strategy. A Wardley Map is built along two axes: 

[insert a Wardley Map image here]

* The y-axis is the “Value Chain” which shows how “close” the individual software/process is to the end users of a product.
* The x-axis shows where the individual components of the product fall along a spectrum of technological evolution – from experimental (early in evolution) to commodity or utility (late stage of evolution).

Among other things, a Wardley Map can help a team make decisions about where to apply modernization efforts. For example, it can demonstrate the benefit of moving from self-managed servers to the cloud. 

Wardley Mapping as a group is important because there can be disagreements about where the components of the product fall along the x or y axes. These disagreements can highlight areas where the organization is not aligned and can show the discovery team where they can focus on building alignment. 

### Validating the path to production

It’s important to have a clear path to deploying to production when a build engagement starts. The “Validating the path to production” exercise is a lightweight exercise for discovery teams to test the pathways to production and highlight any blockers to mitigate before the build engagement starts. 

There are two options: **prototyping a solution** or **asking detailed questions**. Teams can choose to do either or both. 

#### Prototype a solution

Conduct a short prototyping process, as simple as a single-page “Hello World” website, to uncover the agency’s ability to support an agile software development project, in terms of technology and policy. The prototype should aim to be as simple as possible 

The prototype would seek to learn:
* What is the process to gain permission to use the hosting and deployment environment?
* What processes or policies do we have to work through to provision services and deploy applications to them?
* Who are the humans who have to approve stuff? What things do they have to approve? 

If the path to production looks relatively clear, or a “Hello World” prototype proves trivial to deploy, consider expanding the scope of the prototype to include systems or processes that the build team will need to interact with, e.g. existing data systems or APIs.   

#### Ask detailed questions

Pull together a meeting with the relevant individuals at the partner agency – technical, security, CI/CD, etc. – to get clarity on the following questions. 
* How are existing products hosted and deployed? Who is involved in those processes?
* How do we get access to your deployment environment (e.g. Cloud.gov, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, on-premise servers)?
* Are there existing technology stacks / solutions / components that are approved for use or that are recommended for partner agency projects? Are there any strong preferences?
* What processes or policies do we have to work through to provision services and deploy applications to them?
* Who are the humans that have to approve stuff? What things do they have to approve?
