## Introduction

At TTS we do discovery projects before starting on long-term build projects. Discovery is an important step to help shape expectations for the next phase of the project and to build early relationships that will last into the later phases. 
The technical discovery section covers the kind of work and environment that you might expect on a technical discovery project and some tools and ways of thinking that might be beneficial. It covers where to start, types of exercises you can run, and various ways to share what you have learned. 
All technical discovery projects are different, so this should not be seen as a list of requirements to go through, but rather as a set of tools that you can use on the unique problems that your team will face.
