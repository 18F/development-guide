## What kind of things should I ask in technical interviews?

The questions you ask should you’ll want to ask need to help you understand a few things main pieces of information. What technology do they have and how are they using it now? What brought them to where they’re at? How does their technology need to evolve or change to get to where they want to be? Thinking about these points will help lead you to help think about the questions you should be asking.
* What have you learned from the desk research?
    * If any documentation is outdated or wrong, take note of it and use that to start some conversations with people you’re interviewing
    * If any questions come up in your research or interviews, ask the partners or interviewees who else could answer those questions, and email them or set up calls to talk to them
* You can use this document to help design an interview guide.
* You may get an official org chart, but you may want to consider building a shadow org chart. Questions you can ask individuals during interviews:
    * Who energizes you at work? (list 4 or more people)
    * Who do you go to for help and advice? (list 4 or more people)
    * Who do you go to when a decision needs to be made? (list 4 or more people)
* What are the parts of their technology that are working great and they want to keep? (Or “the joys”)
* What are the parts of the technology that are working terribly and they want gone? (or “the pains”)
* What are some ideal-world scenarios for how their technology should function?
* What are the processes that are manually being done that could be automated?
* Where are you stuck, or what is impeding your future work?
* Is there a disconnect between what the organization wants to improve and what technical teams want to improve?
* Where do theyyou think theiryour technical debt is?
    * Are others aware of it?
    * Does theiryour team/organization talk about it?
    * Does the team have investment from the organization to solve it?
    * Is it an organization priority?
