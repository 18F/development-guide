- Create new variables in the following circumstances:
  - The value is repeated twice
  - The value is likely to be updated at least once
  - All occurrences of the value are tied to the variable (for example not by
    coincidence)
- When building scss that will be used across multiple projects use the
  `!default` flag to allow overriding.

  ```scss
  $baseline: 1em !default;
  ```

- The `!global` flag should only be used when overriding a global variable from
  a local scope.
- Variables across the whole scss codebase should be placed in their own file.
- When declaring color variables, don't base the name on the color content.

  ```scss
  // Bad
  $light_blue: #18f;
  $dark_green: #383;

  // Good
  $primary: #18f;
  $secondary: #383;
  $neutral: #ccc;
  ```

- Be careful when naming variables based on their context.

  ```scss
  // Bad
  $background_color: #fff;
  ```

- Don't use the value of dimensional variables in the variable name.

  ```scss
  // Bad
  $width_100: 100em;

  // Good
  $width_lg: 100em;
  ```

- Name all used z-indexes with a variable.
- Have a z-index variable for each z-index used, and a separate variable,
  possibly aliased for where the z-index is used.

  ```scss
  $z_index-neg_1: -100;
  $z_index-neg_2: -200;
  $z_index-1: 100;

  $z_index-hide: $z_index-neg_2;
  $z_index-bg: $z_index-neg_1;
  $z_index-show: $z_index-1;
  ```

## Responsive Design & Breakpoints
- Set variables for breakpoints at the top of your stylesheet. This
  functionality is built into Bourbon.

  ```scss
  $sm: new-breakpoint(min-width 0 max-width 40em $sm_cols);
  ```

- Use variables to set the queries throughout so they are easy to adapt if
  necessary.
- Place media queries nearest to the class they are affecting.
- Rather than focusing on devices when deciding where to put breakpoints, focus
  on content; name breakpoint variables relative to each other.

  ```scss
  // Bad
  $iphone: new-breakpoint(min-width 0 max-width 640px 6);

  // Good
  $small: new-breakpoint(min-width 0 max-width 40em 6);
  $medium: new-breakpoint(min-width 0 max-width 60em 6);
  ```
