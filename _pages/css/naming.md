- HTML elements should be in lowercase.

  ```scss
  body,
  div {
  }
  ```

- Classes should be lowercase.
- Avoid camelcase.
- Name things clearly.
- Write classes semantically. Name its function not its appearance.

  ```scss
  // Bad
  // Avoid uppercase
  .ClassNAME { }

  // Avoid camel case
  .commentForm { }

  // What is a c1-xr? Use a more explicit name.
  .c1-xr { }
  ```

- Avoid presentation- or location-specific words in names, as this will cause
  problems when you (invariably) need to change the color, width, or feature
  later.

  ```scss
  // Bad
  .blue
  .text-gray
  .100width-box

  // Good
  .warning
  .primary
  .lg-box
  ```

- Be wary of naming components based on content, as this limits the use of the
  class.

  ```scss
  // Danger zone
  .product_list

  // Better
  .item_list
  ```

- Don't abbreviate unless it’s a well-known abbreviation.

  ```scss
  // Bad
  .bm-rd

  // Good
  .block--lg
  ```

- Use quotes in type pseudo selectors.

  ```scss
  // Good
  .top_image[type="text"] {
  }
  ```

- Name CSS components and modules with singular nouns.

  ```scss
  .button {
  }
  ```

- Name modifiers and state-based rules with adjectives.

  ```scss
  .is_hovered {
  }
  ```

- If your CSS has to interface with other CSS libraries, consider namespacing
  every class.

  ```css
  .f18-component
  ```


## Naming Methodologies

When it comes to naming, the most important thing is consistency. The
recommended way to do this is using an existing methodology like [BEM](#bem),
or use a custom one that’s clearly defined.

### BEM

[BEM][BEM] (**B**lock, **E**lement, **M**odifier) structures CSS such that
every entity is composed of (you guessed it) blocks, elements and modifiers.
From [Harry Roberts][mindbemding]:

> The point of BEM is to tell other developers more about what a piece of
> markup is doing from its name alone. By reading some HTML with some classes
> in, you can see how – if at all – the chunks are related; something might
> just be a component, something might be a child, or element, of that
> component, and something might be a variation or modifier of that component.

TTS generally recommends using a modified BEM methodology outlined in the next
subsection. However, you might want to use standard BEM when:

* You need a naming scheme that general CSS developers will already be familiar
  with or an existing naming scheme hasn’t been consistent enough.
* When you want to use JavaScript to modify the BEM class names dynamically.

Here is an example of BEM in SCSS:

```scss
// block
.inset {
  margin-left: 15%;

  // element
  .inset__content {
    padding: 3em;
  }
}

// modifier
.inset--sm {
  margin-left: 10%;

  .inset__content {
    padding: 1em;
  }
}

// modifier
.inset--lg {
  margin-left: 20%;
}
```


### Suggested custom methodology

The TTS recommendation for a naming methodology is a modified version of BEM.
It still uses blocks, sections within blocks and modifiers, but with an
abbreviated syntax.

```
.accordion
.accordion-item
.accordion-item-selected

.nav_bar
.nav_bar-link
.nav_bar-link-clicked
```

## js- flagged classes
Don't attach styles to classes with a `js-` flag. These classes are reserved for javascript.

```css
// Bad
.js-people {
  color: #ff0;
}
```

### Rationale
A `js-` flagged class needs to be highly portable. Adding styles to it breaks that portability.

## test- flagged classes
Don't attach styles to classes with a `test-` flag. These classes are reserved for testing hooks such as those used by selenium.

```css
// Bad
.test-people {
  color: #ff0;
}
```
