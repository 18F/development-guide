## Where should I start?

Knowing how to start a technical discovery can help to mitigate the early uncertainty about an engineer’s role on the project. The goal of the first week or so should be to develop context around the partner and the problem and to set up for the next phase of the discovery. Below we’ve listed a few ways that you can build context and how you can use that context to plan for the rest of the discovery.
* Understand how the engagement came to the organization
    * Read business development documentation. You can ask the project’s Account Manager to connect you with the relevant documents
    * Get a sense of the expectations on the partner’s side
    * Review the Path Analysis strategy questions
    * Meet with the project’s Account Manager. You might want to ask some questions like:
        * Who championed this engagement and why?
        * What do the partners understand that we can help them do?
        * Why are partners looking to work with us now?
        * In which system does the partner exist, and what part of it do they make happen?
        * What’s the “system” in relation to this project?
* Start to do the initial research
    * Meet with your team’sthe research colleagues and get a sense of how the team would like to approach research
    * Begin to do desk research. It can be useful to start this before interviewing stakeholders. You can use the partner’s product owner to help connect you to useful documentation
        * Review technical documentation like system diagrams, API documentation, etc.
        * Find any site analytics, data from the partner that clarifies problems/issues
        * Read any recent relevant GAO reports
        * Gather org charts, lists of stakeholders, who is involved in what parts of the process, etc.
            * You want to start to understand things like “Is there a separate part of the org that runs the infrastructure?”
            * Who are the people to talk to to learn the story of where the technology is now? (Or why the technology is where it is)
    * Look at funding and budgets for relevant offices
        * Is there high or low IT spend in certain parts of the organization? Why?
